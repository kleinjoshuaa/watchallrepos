# watchallrepos
A python script allowing you to watch all github repositories for specific github accounts

Fill in the `TARGET_ACCOUNT` and the `GITHUB_USERNAME` in the script for any account that piques your interest. 

In the command line, pass in `-token <personal access token>`

For more information on personal access tokens see this link: [Creating a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

As mentioned in the article I suggest creating a shell variable for your token.
